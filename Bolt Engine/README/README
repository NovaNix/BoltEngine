	Welcome Developers to Bolt!
	
	Bolt is designed to be a simple but powerful 2d Java engine. Before you read or use it,
	know a few things:
	
		-Im garbage at spelling. Tell me when I spell something wrong please.
		-I havent done much documentation, so if you feel like it, document please
		-Im the only one working on the engine, so progress is slow
		-This code has been worked on for a while, so excuse its messyness.
	
	Ive put a lot of work into this engine, however, Im only one guy.
	The engine's current state isnt quite finished. Currently, the primary focus is 
	on rendering, menus, and collisions. Things like audio, tags, and networking 
	wont be finished for a while. 
	
		Current finished things:
		
		-Time Keeping (Needs to be rewritten)
		
		-Rendering  
			Animations (Needs to be rewritten)
			FrameEvents (Needs to be rewritten)
			Image
		
		-Menu (Only Buttons, MenuImage, and MenuText, and the entire Menu package)
	
		-Utils (Some of it needs to be rewritten)
		
		-IO (Only Key, KeyboardKey, MouseKey, and EasyLoader)
		
		-Bodys (Only Surface, AARectangle, and Rectangle)
		
		-Sorting (Only Bubble and Merge)

	If you decide to work on the code, do a few things
	
		-Tell me first (I need to know what you are modifying)
		
		-Ask me anything (I wrote the code, so I can answer some questions about it)
		
		-You may not want to work on the code (Its an absolute mess)
