# Bolt Engine 
Bolt Engine is a simple 2D Videogame Engine built using Java, and utilizes LWJGL 3  
The engine seeks to reduce the code needed to do tasks such as Rendering, Collision Detection, Physics, Audio, and more
## Implemented Features
	- Rendering
	- Collision Detection
	- Raycasting
	- Audio (Ambient only)
	- Saving/Loading
	- Input Detection
## WIP Features
	- Audio (Locational)
	- Switching to LWJGL3 rendering and input
	- Lighting
	- Masking
	- Physics
	- Menus
	- Animations
## Planned Features
	- Networking
## Note
This is my first project that uses Github (and git in general). Keep this in mind for any potential weirdness.
