# Bolt Engine
  Bolt Engine is a simple 2D Videogame Engine built using Java
  
The engine seeks to reduce the code needed to do tasks such as Rendering, Collision Detection, Physics, Audio, and more

Currently, these features are implemented:

  -Basic Rendering (BEING REWORKED)
    Rendering of objects using LWJGL3 (WIP)
    Splitscreen camera support
    Ability to render images and shapes
    Simple 2D animations are supported (BEING REWORKED)
    
  -Collisions through shapes and geometric objects
    Can detect the collisions of polygons and circles
    Can return the point where the contours of shapes intersect
    Raycasting through rays
    
  -Basic Audio
    Ability to play Ambient Noises
    
  -Gathering Keystrokes (BEING REWORKED)
    Ability to detect Mouse
    Ability to detect Keyboard Keys
    
  -File Saving/Loading
    Ability to read a file and turn the contents into a String array
    Ability to modify the contents of a file
    Ability to save the file 
    
Planned features are as follows:

  -Networking
  
  -Camera Filters
