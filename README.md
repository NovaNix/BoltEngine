# Bolt Engine 
Bolt Engine is a simple 2D Videogame Engine built using Java, and utilizes LWJGL 3

## Implemented Features
	- Rendering (Recently switched to OpenGL)
	- Collision Detection
	- Raycasting
	- Audio (Ambient only)
	- Saving/Loading
	- Input Detection (Being redone)
## WIP Features
	- Audio (Locational)
	- Lighting
	- Physics
	- Menus
	- Animations
## Planned Features
	- Networking
## Note
This is my first project that uses Github (and git in general). Keep this in mind for any potential weirdness.
